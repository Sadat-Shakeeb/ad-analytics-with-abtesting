## 📂 Data Sources  
The dataset includes daily performance metrics for both ad platforms from **January 1 to December 31, 2019**:

- **Date** – Daily campaign records  
- **Ad Views** – Total impressions  
- **Ad Clicks** – Number of clicks  
- **Ad Conversions** – Successful conversions  
- **Cost per Ad** – Daily spend  
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** – Clicks ÷ Views  
- **Conversion Rate** – Conversions ÷ Clicks  
- **CPC (Cost per Click)** – Cost ÷ Clicks  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Standardized date formats  
- Converted numerical fields to proper data types  
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates  
- Ensured consistency across both platform data points  

---

## 🛠️ Data Modeling  
Merged and structured datasets for comparative analysis:

- Created **platform indicator columns**  
- Calculated CTR, CPC, and Conversion Rate for both platforms  
- Built additional KPIs and flags for modeling and visualization  

---

## 📊 Statistical & Predictive Analysis  

### **A/B Testing**
- Used **t-tests** to compare Facebook vs. Google AdWords on CTR, CPC, and conversion rate  

### **Regression Modeling**
- Developed a **linear regression model** to predict conversions from clicks  
- Evaluated model accuracy using **R²** and **MSE**  

### **Correlation & Cointegration**
- Explored long-term relationships between ad spend and conversions using **correlation** and **cointegration tests**  

---

## 📈 Data Visualization  
Created visual dashboards using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:

- Line plots: Daily trends of CTR, CPC, and conversions  
- Scatter plots: Clicks vs. Conversions  
- Box plots: Platform-wise distribution of KPIs  
- Time-series: Seasonal patterns and performance variation  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  

### **Platform Performance**
- **Facebook** showed **higher conversion rates** and **lower CPC** than Google AdWords  

### **Budget Optimization**
- Facebook proved more cost-effective, suggesting a shift in ad budget toward it  

### **Seasonal Behavior**
- Conversion rates peaked in Q2 and Q4, highlighting the importance of timing in campaign planning
